# Structure of project microservice on FastAPI 

When it comes to creating microservices using FastAPI, there is no single "best" project structure that will work for every project. However, there are some common patterns and practices that can help you organize your code in a way that makes it more scalable, maintainable, and easy to work with.

Here's an example project structure that you could use as a starting point for your own FastAPI microservices:

```
project/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── endpoints/
│   │   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   │   ├── example.py
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── models/
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       ├── example.py
│   │       └── ...
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── config.py
│   │   ├── logging.py
│   │   ├── security.py
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── db/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── repository.py
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── tests/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── ...
│   └── main.py
├── .env
├── .env.example
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

Here's a brief overview of what each directory and file contains:

- `app`: This is where you'll keep your application code. It contains subdirectories for your API endpoints (`api`), data models (`models`), core utilities (`core`), database access (`db`), and tests (`tests`). The `main.py` file contains the application startup code.

- `core`: This directory contains core application utilities, such as configuration settings, logging, and security helpers.

- `api`: This directory contains your API endpoints. It contains subdirectories for individual endpoints, which in turn contain the actual endpoint code.

- `db`: This directory contains database access code. You'll typically have a single file for each database table or collection.

- `tests`: This directory contains your application tests.

- `.env`: This file contains your application's environment variables.

- `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`: These files contain the Docker configuration for your application.

- `requirements.txt`: This file contains the Python dependencies for your application.

- `README.md`: This file contains information about your application, such as how to install and run it.

Of course, this is just one example of how you could structure your FastAPI microservices. You should adapt it to fit the specific needs of your project. However, this structure should give you a good starting point and help you organize your code in a scalable and maintainable way.
